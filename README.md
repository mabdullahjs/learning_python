# Python Learning Journey

After 3 years of working as a Full Stack Developer (MERN Stack), I’ve finally decided to start learning Python.

As an instructor, I’ve observed that many beginners are often confused about which programming language to start with — Python or JavaScript. From my experience, the answer depends on your goals. However, one thing I always emphasize to my students is this:

> **Before learning any language, framework, library, or tool — be clear about *why* you're learning it.**

For me, the motivation to learn Python is driven by my growing interest in **Generative AI** and **Model Customization Platforms (MCP)** — fields where Python plays a foundational role. Python is not just a popular language; it is the backbone of modern AI and data-driven development.

This repository documents my Python learning process, with code and examples organized by topic. I hope it helps others who are beginning their Python journey with a clear purpose and direction.
