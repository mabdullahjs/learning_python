# Learn Object-Oriented Programming by Answering These Questions

<details>
<summary>
1. Basic Class and Object
</summary>
Problem: Create a **Book** class with attributes like `title` and `author`. Then create an instance of this class.
</details>

<details>
<summary>
2. Class Method and Self
</summary>
Problem: Add a method to the **Book** class that displays the full title as "`title` by `author`".
</details>

<details>
<summary>
3. Inheritance
</summary>
Problem: Create a **EBook** class that inherits from the **Book** class and adds an additional attribute called `file_size`.
</details>

<details>
<summary>
4. Encapsulation
</summary>
Problem: Modify the **Book** class to encapsulate the `title` attribute (make it private), and provide a getter method to access it.
</details>

<details>
<summary>
5. Polymorphism
</summary>
Problem: Define a method `reading_format()` in both **Book** and **EBook** classes that returns different reading formats (e.g., "Printed" for Book and "Digital" for EBook).
</details>

<details>
<summary>
6. Class Variables
</summary>
Problem: Add a class variable to the **Book** class that keeps track of how many Book instances have been created.
</details>

<details>
<summary>
7. Static Method
</summary>
Problem: Add a static method to the **Book** class that returns a general description of what a book is.
</details>

<details>
<summary>
8. Property Decorators
</summary>
Problem: Use a property decorator in the **Book** class to make the `author` attribute read-only.
</details>

<details>
<summary>
9. Class Inheritance and isinstance() Function
</summary>
Problem: Demonstrate the use of `isinstance()` to check if `my_ebook` is an instance of **Book** and **EBook**.
</details>

<details>
<summary>
10. Multiple Inheritance
</summary>
Problem: Create two classes: **Publisher** and **Language**. Let the **EBook** class inherit from both to demonstrate multiple inheritance.
</details>
