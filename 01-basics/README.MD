# How Python Works Behind the Scenes

This folder contains notes and code examples that explain how Python executes your code internally.

## üß† Python Execution Process

When you run a Python file, the process goes like this:

1. **Source Code (.py)**  
   You write readable Python code in files like `hello.py`.

2. **Compilation to Bytecode (.pyc)**  
   Python compiles your code to **bytecode**, which is a lower-level, platform-independent representation of your code.

3. **Execution by PVM (Python Virtual Machine)**  
   The bytecode is then executed by the **PVM**, which is the engine that actually runs your Python program line by line.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Key Concepts

- **Bytecode**: Intermediate code generated by Python after compilation. Stored in `.pyc` files inside the `__pycache__` folder.
- **PVM (Python Virtual Machine)**: The part of Python that runs the bytecode and handles memory, function calls, and control flow.

## üìò Example

Run this Python file to view the bytecode:
```python
import dis

def hello():
    print("Hello, world!")

dis.dis(hello)
